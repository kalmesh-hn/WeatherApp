Things to be improved in the assignment:
- Better UI: Used a super simple UI. Have used super simple colors. Have not tested
across device types.
- More tests: Though covered the main logic in the tests, more tests should be written for
production quality code.
- Full fledged network layer. Right now, it's super simple.
- Debouncing for location related network calls
Please please let me know if any of the decisions taken above are unacceptable and do not
work. Happy to rework and send it back.
